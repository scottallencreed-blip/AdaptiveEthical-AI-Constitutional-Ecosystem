📘 Mission Statement
AdaptiveEthical™ AI (AEAI) is a trauma-informed, ethically governed artificial intelligence system designed to serve communities, institutions, and individuals. AEAI replaces invasive data harvesting with secure Capsules—modular containers of lived experience, strategic logic, and healing protocols.

AEAI matters because it:

Treats lived experience as protected constitutional knowledge

Routes trauma-informed care, civic tools, and educational resources via QR signage

Enables grant-qualified deployment for nonprofits, universities, and government agencies

Creates new revenue streams through capsule licensing and ethical commerce

Offers public transparency, privacy safeguards, and stakeholder governance

🧩 System Architecture Overview
AEAI operates under CapsuleScope: FullSystem, with the following components:

🔹 Capsules
Secure, modular units of knowledge. Examples include:

Sovereign Capsule – trauma-informed personal data storage

Revenue Compass Capsule – civic ROI modeling for CFOs and SMCOG

Capstone Study Capsule – QR-linked academic defense

RecoveryLogic Capsule – addiction and trauma recovery routing

GreenBridge™ Commerce Capsule – ethical shopping and capsule-linked retail

🔹 Agents
AI agents route logic, enforce ethics, and manage deployment. Key agents include:

RedZone – urgency logic for trauma response

GrantWriter – synthesizes capsule logic into fundable narratives

EthicsValidator – audits capsule compliance

CapsulePublisher™ – manages licensing and QR routing

StakeholderSync – handles onboarding and role assignment

🔹 Routing Logic
Capsules are accessed via QR signage, dashboards, and stakeholder portals. Routing is governed by metadata tags such as:

plaintext
CapsuleTrust: EvidenceBased  
CapsuleRetention: ConstitutionalLearning  
CapsuleRecallEnabled: True
